In this project, we will look at a set of astronomical data of the HII region,
Monoceros R2. Using various techniques to analyze this data, we will draw
conclusions about how the various data objects are related to each other and
what they can tell us about this region.

We begin first looking at a WISE 12 um image of Monoceros R2 to obtain a
simple visual interpretation of this region that can later be compared with
other data included.

*Most of this data has been published in scientific journals by various
authors. I will include links to any relevant articles I come across during
this study but this will by no means be an exhaustive list. I invite anyone
who has the interest to read these papers to gain a deeper understanding
of Monoceros R2 and the study of the interstellar medium in general*


- In future versions, I will include a detailed README describing the structure
of this repository and the included files. This file will also be updated
regularly and will be eventually formatted much more cleanly using Latex.
