Import spectral cube of Monoceros R2 (cite Berne + 2009 for publication of data)

make simple visualization with spectral aperture overplotted on image of Mon R2

stitch spectral orders, make final cube

derive continuum components

derive fluxes and uncertainties

output spectral maps

output correlation plots

output heatmap of correlation coefficients

machine learning to derive correlation relationships?

output line projections

histogram visualizations?

compare with FIR observations?
