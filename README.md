##                     Project Overview                         


In this project, we will look at a set of astronomical data of the HII region,
**Monoceros R2**. Using various techniques to analyze this data, we will draw
conclusions about how the various data objects are related to each other and
what they can tell us about this region.  

1. We begin first looking at a **WISE 12 um** image of Monoceros R2 to obtain a
   simple visual interpretation of this region that can later be compared with
   other data in [Monoceros R2 Introduction Notebook](https://github.com/cknigh24/monR2/blob/main/MonR2_Intro.ipynb). 
   The fits file required to run cells this notebook may be downloaded from the following url for users 
   who are so inclined:

2. Generalized Python modules based on this introductory notebook will be designed and
   applied to other Monoceros R2 image products for future analysis. The quality of
   these modules can be further tested on astronomical images of other sources. 

3. Spectroscopic data reduction and analysis of a Spitzer IRS data cube centered
   on Monoceros R2 

*Most of this data has been published in scientific journals by various
authors. I will include links to any relevant articles I come across during
this study but this will by no means be an exhaustive list. I invite anyone
who has the interest to read these papers to gain a deeper understanding
of Monoceros R2 and the study of the interstellar medium in general*
